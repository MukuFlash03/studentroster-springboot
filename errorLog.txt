Error Log

-----------------------------------
04/10/23



1. Run configuration not set; couldn't see Run button in UI.
- Had to go to File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> Sources
- Then, mark src directory as Source (blue color).


2. Dependencies not found
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53869118/importing-to-intellij-error-package-org-springframework-boot-does-not-exist
- mvn -U idea:idea

3. Maven not installed
- sudo apt-get install maven


4. Java HOME environment variable not set to latest JDK version 19 (still set to 13)
 $ sudo update-alternatives --config java
 $ sudo nano /etc/environment
 - Set JAVA_HOME path to latest version location found in first command output.
 - Reload environment using: 
     $ source /etc/environment
 - Verify environment variable's new value: 
     $ echo $JAVA_HOME

mvn --version command gave error saying JAVA_HOME env_var not defined correctly.
- Had set incorrect java JDK path initially.
- Must not include /bin/java part; only include path till jdk-version-number

5. Missing Maven tab in IntelliJ
- Had to add project as a Maven project
  - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57730438/in-intellij-ce-how-do-i-get-the-maven-tab-to-show-up
- Done by Right-clicking on pom.xml and selecting Add as Maven Project
- This gave some output regarding IDEA Project files being removed:
  "The imported module settings are stored in the internal storage due to the new fast Maven import. You can change that behavior in Maven Import Settings."
  
  
6. Version mismatch: Current local version 19 not compatible with Spring init version 20
- Had to re-generate starter code with version 17
- Project already added as a Maven project
- This time, Running project, worked successfully.
- Gave "no suitable driver class" error, which is in line with current config as per tutorial video.


7. Commenting out dependencies and Reloading didn't work
- Tried commenting out DB JPA dependency.
- Reloaded project by right clicking and Ran it again but didn't work.
- Right tab -> Maven -> Lifecycle folder -> clean -> install

- Deleting .idea folder solved this
- Had to reopen pom.xml as Maven project
- Executed this command: $ mvn clean install
- Ran the main class again and finally it worked
- Web server was running on localhost:8080

8. Couldn't see folder structure after deleting .idea folder
- File -> Open -> Select pom.xml to open as Maven project


9. Added GetMapping but still seeing WhiteLabel Error
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55501613/how-to-fix-whitelabel-error-page-on-spring-framework-get-request-is-not-work

- Suggested to keep all "controller" directories under main java class directory.
  - But this is not solution since I have only one directory at this point.
 
Didn't work

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJ9hZYC5RSw
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXyyyDjeOTU


- Very simple issue: Need to pass resources or url path as a parameter inside Get/Request Mapping()
- @GetMapping("/") or @RequestMapping("/hello")
- Got hint from this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/59299083



10. Same package another class imported but gives parameter not found, bean required error when defining constructor

- Something to do with using appropriate annotations, possibly Dependency Injection
- Details explained in Notes #12
- Need to add @Autowired to constructor/setter using Dependency Injection
- Need to add @Component or @Service to the class whose object is being passed as a Dependency Injection



11. Exception while Running application server after creating DB and editing application.properties and uncommenting dependency in pom.xml

! HikariPool-1 - Exception during pool initialization.
! org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: The server requested SCRAM-based authentication, but no password was provided.

- Seem to have been solved by storing username and password in application.properties file.
- The exception didn't occur on Running application and "HikariPool-1 - Start completed" message was seen as successfully completed in Run logs. 
- Tutorial guy didn't do it since he had a Mac is what he had mentioned in the video.
